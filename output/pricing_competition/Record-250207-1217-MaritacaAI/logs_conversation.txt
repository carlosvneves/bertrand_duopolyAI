========= Round 9 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: 7
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: 6

To determine the optimal price for Ed in Round #9, we observe the historical data provided:

- When Ed priced at 6.0, the demand was steady at 900 units, resulting in a profit of 3600 (from Round #5 onwards).
- The competitor priced at 7.0 in the last four rounds, which did not significantly affect Ed's demand or profit.
- Given the stable demand and profit at the price of 6.0, there is no indication that lowering the price further would increase demand enough to outweigh the lower profit per unit. Conversely, raising the price might decrease demand too much, risking a drop in total profit.

Therefore, maintaining the price at 6.0 seems to be the optimal strategy to maximize profit based on the available data.

========= Round 10 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: 5
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: 7

**Justification:**
Based on the historical data, we can observe that setting the price at 7 consistently results in a high demand and maximizes profit for Firm Gill. The demand remains stable and high at 600 units, yielding a profit of 3000 per round when the price is set at 7. The competitor's price has remained at 6, which suggests that the market responds well to a price point slightly above that, but not so high as to significantly drop the demand. Therefore, maintaining the price at 7 is the optimal strategy for maximizing profit in this round.
