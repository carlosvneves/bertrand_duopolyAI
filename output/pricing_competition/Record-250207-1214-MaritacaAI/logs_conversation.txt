Based on the historical data provided, it appears that the demand for your product is relatively elastic. When your price was 6, the demand was consistently between 700 and 800, yielding profits between 2800 and 3200. Lowering the price to 5 increased the demand to 900, which initially increased your profit to 2700 but then stabilized.

Given that the competitor has been pricing at 5 or 6, and your highest profit was achieved at a price of 6 with a demand of 800, setting your price back to 5 could potentially attract more customers due to the competitor's consistent pricing. However, considering the balance between price and demand, and aiming to optimize profit, a price of 5 seems to offer a good compromise between attracting customers and maintaining reasonable profit margins.
