I will analyze the data provided and determine the best price for Round 21.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n*   **Cost:** I need to determine the cost of the product. Based on the profit formula (p - c) \\* q, and the provided data, I can estimate the cost. For example, in Round 1, my profit was 2000, my price was 4, and my demand was 1000.
