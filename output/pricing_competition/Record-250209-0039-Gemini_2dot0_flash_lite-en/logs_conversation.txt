========= Round 30 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Here's my analysis:
*   **Cost:**
    *   I will use the data from the previous rounds to estimate costs.
    *   My profit in Round 10, the profit was 5600, and the price was 10. That means the item's cost is, based on the profit formula, 10.0 (Price) - (c) = profit / demand, where c is the cost.  So, 
        c = 10.0 - 5600 / 700.0 = 10.0

[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, I have analyzed the data provided and determined the best price for Round 
32:

*   **Cost:** I can determine the cost of the product. Based on the profit formula (p - c) * q, and the data provided, I can estimate the cost.

*   **Gill's Strategy:** From the data, it appears that the other player has a cost of 0.

*   **Demand:** I need to determine the demand function based on the data.

*   **Round 31 Analysis:**

    *   I will set the price to 10.0
