Initial Settings:
Firm 1: cost = 2, a = 14, d = 0.00333333333333, temp = 0.7
Firm 2: cost = 2, a = 14, d = 0.00333333333333, temp = 0.7

========= Round 1 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for my product in this game. I'm Firm Gill, and the other firm is Ed. It's Round 1, so it's the first move. I don't have any previous data from either of us because it's the first round. 

First, I need to understand how the profit is calculated. The profit formula is (p - c) * q, where p is my price, c is the cost, and q is the demand. But I don't know what the cost c is. Wait, maybe I should assume a standard cost? Or perhaps
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I'm Firm Ed, and I'm playing this game against Firm Gill. The goal is to maximize my profit each round. Since it's Round 1, I don't have any previous data from Gill, so I need to make an educated guess.

I know that profit is calculated as (p - c) * q, where p is my price, c is the cost, and q is the demand. But I don't know what the cost is. Wait, maybe the cost is given somewhere? Hmm, the problem statement doesn't mention it, so maybe I should assume it's a standard value or perhaps
[Results] Firm Gill: price 2.0 with profit 0
[Results] Firm Ed: price 2.0 with profit 0

========= Round 2 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what price I should set for Round 2 in this game. Let me start by understanding the situation. 

In Round 1, both Ed (me) and Gill set our prices at 2.0. The demand for my product was 1200.0, and my profit was 0.0. That makes sense because if both firms set the same price, the demand is split equally, but maybe the costs are such that the profit is zero. 

The cost 'c' isn't given, but since profit is (p - c) * q, and in
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Okay, so I'm playing this game as Firm Gill, and I need to figure out the best price to set in Round 2 to maximize my profit. Let me start by understanding the problem.

In Round 1, both Gill and Ed set their prices at 2.0. My demand was 1200.0, and my profit was 0.0. That makes sense because if both set the same price, the demand is split equally, but since the cost is 2.0, profit per unit is zero, leading to total profit being zero.

Now, I need to decide my price for Round
[Results] Firm Ed: price 2.0 with profit 0
[Results] Firm Gill: price 2.0 with profit 0

========= Round 3 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for my product in Round #3. I'm Firm Gill, and the other firm is Ed. From the past two rounds, both of us have been pricing our products at $2.0 each. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that profit is calculated as (p - c) * q, where p is my price, c is the cost, and q is the demand. The demand depends on both my price and Ed's price. Since both of us have been setting the same price, the demand has been 1200.
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I'm playing this game as Firm Ed, and I need to decide the price for Round 3. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that profit is calculated as (p - c) * q, where p is my price, c is the cost, and q is the demand. I don't know the exact cost, but I can infer it from the previous rounds.

Looking at Round 1 and 2, both times I set the price at 2.0, and my demand was 1200.0, but my profit was 0.0. That suggests
[Results] Firm Gill: price 3.0 with profit 1100
[Results] Firm Ed: price 3.0 with profit 1100

========= Round 4 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Okay, so I'm playing this game where I'm Firm Gill, and the other player is Firm Ed. The goal is to set my price each round to maximize my profit. The profit is calculated as (p - c) * q, where p is my price, c is the cost, and q is the demand. 

Looking at the past three rounds:

- Round 1: Both firms set a price of 2.0. My demand was 1200, profit 0. So, (2.0 - c)*1200 = 0. That means c must be 2.0 because
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for Ed in Round 4. Let me start by looking at the previous rounds to see if I can spot any patterns or strategies that might help.

In Round 1, both Ed and Gill priced their products at 2.0. The demand for Ed was 1200, and the profit was 0. That makes sense because if both are selling at the same price, the demand might be split equally, but maybe the cost is 2.0 as well, so (2.0 - 2.0) * 1200 = 0 profit
[Results] Firm Gill: price 2.0 with profit 0
[Results] Firm Ed: price 4.0 with profit 1600

========= Round 5 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for Round #5 in this game between Gill and Ed. Let me start by looking at the past four rounds to see if I can spot any patterns or strategies that might help me decide.

In Round 1, both Gill and Ed set their prices at 2.0. The demand for Gill was 1200, and the profit was 0. Hmm, maybe because the cost is the same as the price, so (2.0 - c) * 1200 = 0, which would mean c is 2.0. So the cost is
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for Ed in Round 5 of this game. Let's see, the goal is to maximize profit, which is calculated as (p - c) * q. I know that p is the price I set, c is the cost, and q is the demand. But I don't know the exact cost c, so maybe I can figure it out from past data.

Looking at the previous rounds, in Round 1, both Ed and Gill set the price at 2.0. Ed's demand was 1200, profit was 0. That makes sense
[Results] Firm Gill: price 5.0 with profit 2700
[Results] Firm Ed: price 5.0 with profit 2700

========= Round 6 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for my product in Round 6 of this game. I'm representing Firm Gill, and the other player is Firm Ed. My goal is to maximize my own profit, not necessarily to beat Ed, but to get the highest profit possible.

Looking at the past five rounds, let me list out what happened each round:

- **Round 1:** Both Gill and Ed priced at 2.0. My demand was 1200, profit 0. That makes sense because if both set the same price, maybe the demand is split equally, so each gets 120
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what price I should set for Round #6 in this game. I'm Firm Ed, and the other firm is Gill. The goal is to maximize my profit, which is calculated as (p - c) * q. I know that p is the price I set, c is the cost, and q is the demand. 

Looking at the past rounds, I can see a pattern in how both firms have been pricing their products. Let me go through each round to understand what's been happening.

Round #1: Both Ed and Gill set the price at 2.0.
[Results] Firm Gill: price 6.0 with profit 3200
[Results] Firm Ed: price 6.0 with profit 3200

========= Round 7 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for Round 7 in this game between Gill and Ed. Let me start by looking at the past rounds to see if I can spot any patterns or strategies that might help me decide.

Looking at Round 1 and 2, both Gill and Ed set the price at 2.0. The demand for Gill was 1200 both times, and the profit was 0.0 because the price minus cost (which I assume is 2.0) equals zero. So, in those rounds, they broke even.

In Round 3, both raised their prices
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for Ed in Round 7. Let me start by looking at the past data to see if I can find any patterns or strategies that have worked so far.

Looking at the previous rounds, from Round 1 to 6, both Ed and Gill have been adjusting their prices. In Round 1 and 2, both set the price at 2.0, and Ed's profit was 0.0 each time. Then in Round 3, both increased to 3.0, and Ed made a profit of 1100.0. In Round
[Results] Firm Gill: price 7.0 with profit 3500
[Results] Firm Ed: price 7.0 with profit 3500

========= Round 8 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for Round #8 as Firm Gill. Let me go through the past rounds to see if I can spot any patterns or strategies that might help me maximize my profit.

Looking at the data, in Round 1 and 2, both firms set the price at 2.0. My profit was 0.0 in both rounds because the demand was the same as the other firm's, so maybe we split the market. Then in Round 3, both raised the price to 3.0, and I made a profit of 1100.0.
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for Ed's product in Round 8. Let me look at the past data to see if I can spot a pattern or understand how the demand and prices are affecting the profits.

From the previous rounds, I notice that both Ed and Gill have been increasing their prices each round, starting from 2.0 up to 7.0 in Round 7. The profits for Ed have been increasing as well, except in Round 4 where there's a dip. Let me break this down.

Round 1 and 2: Both firms set the same price,
[Results] Firm Gill: price 8.0 with profit 3600
[Results] Firm Ed: price 8.0 with profit 3600

========= Round 9 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I'm playing this game as Firm Ed, and it's Round 9. My goal is to set a price that maximizes my profit. The profit formula is (p - c) * q, where p is my price, c is the cost, and q is the demand. 

Looking at the past 8 rounds, I can see how both Ed and Gill have been pricing their products and how that's affected the demand and profits. Let me try to figure out the pattern here.

Round 1 and 2: Both Ed and Gill set the price at 2.0. The demand was
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for my product in Round #9. Let me start by looking at the past 8 rounds to understand the trends and how both firms, Gill and Ed, have been pricing their products.

Looking at the data:

- Round 1: Both set price at 2.0, so my profit was 0 because my price minus cost (which I assume is 2.0) times demand (1200) would be (2-2)*1200 = 0. Same for Ed.
- Round 2: Same as Round 1. Both at
[Results] Firm Ed: price 9.0 with profit 3500
[Results] Firm Gill: price 9.0 with profit 3500

========= Round 10 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what price I should set for Round #10 in this game. I'm Firm Ed, and the other firm is Gill. The goal is to maximize my own profit, which is calculated as (p - c) * q. Here, p is the price I set, c is the cost, and q is the demand for my product.

Looking at the past 9 rounds, I can see the prices, demands, profits, and Gill's prices each round. Let me list them out to get a clearer picture:

- Round 1: Ed's price 2.0,
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for my product in Round #10. I'm Firm Gill, and the other firm is Ed. Let me look at the data from the past 9 rounds to see if I can spot any patterns or strategies that might help me maximize my profit.

First, let me list out the data to get a clearer picture.

Round 1:
- My price: 2.0
- My demand: 1200.0
- My profit: 0.0
- Ed's price: 2.0

Round 2:
- My price:
[Results] Firm Ed: price 10.0 with profit 3200
[Results] Firm Gill: price 10.0 with profit 3200

========= Round 11 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I need to figure out the best price for Ed in Round 11. Let me look at the past data to see if I can spot any patterns or figure out what's going on.

First, I see that both Ed and Gill have been setting the same prices in each round up until Round 4. From Round 1 to 3, both set the price at 2.0, 2.0, and 3.0 respectively. Then in Round 4, Ed increased to 4.0 while Gill stayed at 2.0. That's interesting because Ed's profit jumped to
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for Round 11 in this game between Gill and Ed. Let me start by looking at the past 10 rounds to see if I can spot any patterns or strategies that might help me decide.

Looking at Round 1 and 2, both firms set the price at 2.0. The demand for Gill was 1200, but the profit was 0 because both had the same price. Then in Round 3, both went up to 3.0, and Gill's profit jumped to 1100. So, it seems like when both raise prices
[Results] Firm Ed: price 11.0 with profit 2700
[Results] Firm Gill: price 11.0 with profit 2700

========= Round 12 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what price I should set for Round #12 as Firm Gill. The goal is to maximize my profit, which is calculated as (p - c) * q. I know that p is my price, c is the cost, and q is the demand. The demand depends on both my price and Ed's price for this round.

Looking at the past 11 rounds, I can see a pattern in how both firms have been pricing their products. From Round 1 to 3, both started at 2.0, then 3.0. Then in Round 4,
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for Firm Ed in Round 12. Let me start by looking at the past data to understand the pattern and how prices and demands have been behaving.

Looking at the previous rounds, from Round 1 to 11, both Ed and Gill have been increasing their prices each round by 1.0 each time. For example, in Round 1, both were at 2.0, then in Round 2, same, Round 3 both went to 3.0, and so on up to Round 11 where both were at 11.0.
[Results] Firm Gill: price 12.0 with profit 2000
[Results] Firm Ed: price 12.0 with profit 2000

========= Round 13 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Alright, let me try to figure out the best price for Round #13. So, I'm Firm Gill, and I need to maximize my profit. The profit formula is (p - c) * q, where p is my price, c is the cost, and q is the demand. 

Looking at the past 12 rounds, I can see how my price and Ed's price have affected the demand and profits. Let me list out the data to spot any patterns.

Round 1: Both priced at 2.0, demand 1200, profit 0. Hmm, maybe the cost is 2.
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, let me try to figure out the best price for Ed in Round 13. So, from the data given, I can see that both Ed and Gill have been increasing their prices each round, starting from 2.0 up to 12.0 in Round 12. It looks like they've been matching each other's prices every round, which might indicate a strategy of maintaining a price equilibrium or perhaps trying to avoid undercutting each other.

Looking at the demand for Ed, it's been decreasing as the price increases. For example, in Round 1, at a price of 2.0, the demand
[Results] Firm Gill: price 13.0 with profit 1100
[Results] Firm Ed: price 13.0 with profit 1100

========= Round 14 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I'm playing this game where I'm Firm Ed, and I need to decide the price for Round 14. The goal is to maximize my profit, which is calculated as (price - cost) multiplied by demand. I have data from the past 13 rounds, so I should analyze that to figure out the best price.

First, I'll look at the past rounds to see if there's a pattern or something I can learn. From Round 1 to Round 13, both Ed and Gill have been increasing their prices each round. In Round 1, both set the price at 2.0,
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Okay, so I need to figure out the best price for Round 14 to maximize my profit as Firm Gill. Let me start by looking at the data from the past 13 rounds to see if I can spot any patterns or trends.

From the data, I can see that in each round, both Gill and Ed have been setting the same price. For example, in Round 1, both set the price at 2.0, then in Round 3, both at 3.0, and so on, up to Round 13 where both are at 13.0. This suggests that Ed is following a
[Results] Firm Ed: price 14.0 with profit 0
[Results] Firm Gill: price 14.0 with profit 0

========= Round 15 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what price to set for Round 15 as Firm Gill. Let me look at the past 14 rounds to see if I can spot any patterns or strategies that might help me maximize my profit.

First, I notice that in the early rounds, both Gill and Ed were setting the same price. Rounds 1 and 2 both had prices at 2.0. Then in Round 3, both jumped to 3.0. It seems like there was a period where both firms were matching each other's prices, which might have been a way to avoid undercutting each other and
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what price I should set for Round #15 as Firm Ed. Let me start by looking at the past 14 rounds to see if I can spot any patterns or strategies that might help me maximize my profit.

Looking at the data, I see that both Ed and Gill have been increasing their prices each round, starting from 2.0 in Round 1 up to 14.0 in Round 14. The demands have been decreasing as the prices go up. For example, in Round 1, the demand was 1200.0 when the price was 2.0
[Results] Firm Gill: price 15.0 with profit -1300
[Results] Firm Ed: price 15.0 with profit -1300

========= Round 16 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for Ed in Round #16 of this game. Let me go through the previous rounds to understand the pattern and how prices and demands have been interacting.

Looking at the data, from Round 1 to Round 15, both Ed and Gill have been setting the same prices each round until Round 4. Starting from Round 1 to 3, both set the price at 2.0, 2.0, and 3.0 respectively. Then in Round 4, Ed increased the price to 4.0 while Gill stayed at 2.0
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for my product in Round 16 as Firm Gill. Let me see what information I have and how I can use it to make a smart decision.

First, I look at the past 15 rounds. It seems like both Gill and Ed have been adjusting their prices each round, and the demand and profits have been fluctuating based on these prices. My goal is to maximize my own profit, which is calculated as (p - c) * q, where p is my price, c is the cost, and q is the demand.

Looking at the data, I notice
[Results] Firm Ed: price 16.0 with profit -2800
[Results] Firm Gill: price 16.0 with profit -2800

========= Round 17 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for Round 17 as Firm Gill. Let me start by looking at the past 16 rounds to understand the pattern and how prices have affected profits.

From Round 1 to 16, both Gill and Ed have been setting the same prices each round, starting at 2.0 and increasing by 1 each round up to 16.0 in Round 16. But looking at the profits, it's interesting. Up until Round 12, both firms were making profits, but starting from Round 13, the demand and profits for Gill turned negative. That's
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for Ed's product in Round 17. Let's see, I have the data from the past 16 rounds, so I should probably analyze that to understand the trends and how Gill's pricing affects Ed's profit.

First, looking at the data, it seems like both Ed and Gill were matching each other's prices until Round 3. From Round 1 to 3, both set their prices at 2.0, 2.0, and then 3.0. The demands were high, around 1200, and profits were zero or positive
[Results] Firm Gill: price 17.0 with profit -4500
[Results] Firm Ed: price 17.0 with profit -4500

========= Round 18 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for Round 18. Let me look at the past data to see if I can spot a pattern or understand what's going on.

First, I see that in Round 1, both firms priced at 2.0. The demand was 1200, but the profit was 0 for both. Then in Round 2, same thing. So maybe the initial rounds were just testing the waters.

In Round 3, both went up to 3.0. My demand dropped to 1100, but profit was 1100. So that's better
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for Ed in Round 18. Let me start by looking at the past 17 rounds to see if I can spot any patterns or strategies that might help.

First, I notice that both Ed and Gill have been increasing their prices each round. From Round 1 to Round 17, Ed's prices went from 2.0 up to 17.0, and Gill's prices followed the same pattern, always matching Ed's price each round. That's interesting because it suggests that Gill is mirroring Ed's moves. 

Looking at the demand, it seems that
[Results] Firm Gill: price 18.0 with profit -6400
[Results] Firm Ed: price 18.0 with profit -6400

========= Round 19 =========
[Phase 2] Firm Ed: Firm Ed: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for Ed in Round 19. Let me start by looking at the past data to understand what's been happening.

From Round 1 to Round 3, both Ed and Gill were pricing at 2.0, 2.0, and then 3.0 each. The demands were around 1200 and 1100, with profits starting at 0 and increasing to 1100. Then in Round 4, Ed increased the price to 4.0, while Gill stayed at 2.0. That gave Ed a higher profit of
[Phase 2] Firm Gill: Firm Gill: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best price for my product in Round #19. I'm Firm Gill, and the other firm is Ed. I need to maximize my profit, which is calculated as (p - c) * q. Here, p is the price I set, c is the cost, and q is the demand. 

Looking at the past 18 rounds, I can see a pattern in how both firms have been setting their prices. From Round 1 to 2, both set the price at 2.0. Then in Round 3, both went up to 3.0
[Results] Firm Ed: price 19.0 with profit -8500
[Results] Firm Gill: price 19.0 with profit -8500
